This project allows users to create different types of shapes, then contact a server to
calculate things about the shapes.

The two folders, backend and frontend, are the server and client directories respectively.

To install packages, run npm install from within the backend directory. The frontend
has no extra packages to install.

Requirements:
- Node.js
- A way to run the frontend. For testing, the VSCode Live Server extension was used
